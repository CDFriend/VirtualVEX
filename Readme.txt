1. Why Edit?
Having access to the source code allows you to edit VirtualVEX. This can serve a number of
purposes. For example, some teams may have a robot design radically different from the
default robots and may wish to, for the purpose of more realism, replace the default
robots with their own design. This may require adding custom code to reflect the type of
intake desired. Also, developers may have a way of fixing bugs or improving realism, and
they can edit the source code and contact us with their fix.

2. Permissions and Rights.
Permission is hereby granted to edit, fix, or alter this source code in any way you like.
Permission is also granted to release your changes publicly. However if you do publicly
release any edited version of the program you may create, please give credit where credit
is due - a link to the VirtualVEX website would be most welcome.
Please be aware that current versions of VirtualVEX are released under the GNU General
Public License, which involves certain responsibilities for anybody wishing to redistribute
the binaries or source code. Please read the GPL before choosing to publicly redistribute
VirtualVEX.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Unity Source Format
VirtualVEX was created with Unity. The source code is thus in the form of a Unity project.
The project has already been synced with a MonoDevelop / Visual Studio project and the
necessary solution files are found in the root directory. You should be familiar with Unity
and its method of project organization before you proceed to edit this source code. All
necessary assets are included and can be replaced with your own versions. All Unity scenes
- each corresponding to a menu or simulation mode - are also packaged. In other words, if
you have Unity installed you can open the root folder as a Unity project and get right 
to work.
